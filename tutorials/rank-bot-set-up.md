# Rank bot set-up



## **Retrieving a valid `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie**

To bypass Roblox's IP region lock on `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookies, you must create the token from the desired location. In this case, we want to obtain a cookie that appears to be from North America, specifically Washington D.C., United States. The easiest way to achieve this is by using a VPN service.

_**If you already live in North America, you can go straight to step 4.**_

1. Sign out of the target Roblox account if you are currently logged in.
2. Choose a reliable VPN service that offers servers in Washington D.C. Some popular options include NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and CyberGhost. Subscribe to the service and install the VPN client on your device.
3. Launch the VPN client and connect to a server located in Washington D.C. Make sure the connection is stable before proceeding.
4. Open your web browser in incognito mode to ensure a clean session without any cached data:
   * For Google Chrome, press `Ctrl + Shift + N` (Windows/Linux) or `Command + Shift + N` (Mac).
   * For Microsoft Edge, press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Command + Shift + P` (Mac).
   * For Mozilla Firefox, press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Command + Shift + P` (Mac).
5. In the incognito window, navigate to the Roblox login page: [https://www.roblox.com/login](https://www.roblox.com/login)
6. Log in to the target Roblox account. After a successful login, the `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie will be associated with the Washington D.C. IP region.
7. Retrieve the `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie using your preferred method (e.g., browser developer tools, browser extensions, or by copying it from the browser's storage).
8. Submit the retrieved `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie through the provided form on the manage guild page of whatever guild you want to add a rank bot too (Find your guilds [here](https://rolinker.net/manage/guilds)). Double-check that the cookie is correct before submitting.
9. Close the incognito window and disconnect from the VPN. **Do not** press the "Log out" button on the Roblox website, as this will invalidate the cookie.

From now on, whenever you use the `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie obtained through this method, Roblox will consider your IP to be from North America. **Keep in mind that logging into the account without the VPN connection or from a different location may violate the IP check and invalidate the cookie.**
